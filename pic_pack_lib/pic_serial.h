    \brief Configure the pic for serial communicaitons

	and getting the baud rate generator set up.  After calling this
	you can immediately start sending and receiving bytes.

/**

 \brief Transmit a single character
 
 Sends a single character out the serial connection.  It is sent straight
 out if possible, otherwise put into the fifo. Note that if you fill the
 fifo while interrupts are off (eg, in an interrupt routine or a critical section)
 then this routine will hang the pic, since it's waiting for an interrupt to clear
 the fifo, which never comes... The moral is to keep your fifo big enough or
 don't send too much while interrupts are off (eg, in an interrupt
 response routine).  Of course, you *can* send things in an ISR - just don't
 fill the fifo up.
 
 \param c the character to transmit

/**

	\brief Retrieve a character from the serial port
	
	Retrieve character from the serial port.  Note that if there is nothing
	in the fifo, this function will wait until a character is received - and
	this will never happen if interrupts are turned off when this is called!
	So, be careful not to call getc during a critical section or during an ISR
	*unless* you're sure there's something in the fifo. You can do this by calling
	the serial_rx_avail() routine.  In any other situation, you can call getc()
	and happily wait for a character to arrive.
